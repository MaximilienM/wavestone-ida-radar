A test project library that generates an interactive radar adapted for Trello input, inspired by [thoughtworks.com/radar](http://thoughtworks.com/radar).

## Purpose
Adapt the ThoughtWorks Radar library for internal use
- change the data source to enable private data [covered in add-ons of this test project]
- adapt to be able to list more category of radar [not covered in add-ons of this test project]

Beware : this library is under AGPL licence, any modification must be shared

## What's in the library thoughtworks.com/radar

**Tools** : webpack is used to concatenate all file. Run webpack command to generate index.html, hash.js and has.css that are created in /dist/ directory
Webpackconfig can be changed in webpack.config.js

**Usefull file and class** :
- *index.html* is the start, and triggers */dist/hash.js*, generated by webpack
- in *webpack.config.js*, the starting point is *site.js*, which triggers *GoogleSheetInput function* located in */util/factory.js*
- */util/factory.js* is the core of generating data from a sheet with the main functions :


    const GoogleSheetInput = function () { // triggers GoogleSheet
        self.build 
            var queryParams = QueryParams(window.location.search.substring(1)); // deal with the provided url
            var sheet = GoogleSheet(queryParams.sheetId, queryParams.sheetName);
    
    const GoogleSheet = function (sheetReference, sheetName) {
        self.build  
            function createRadar(sheets, tabletop) { // uses Tabletop module
            function 
        self.init = function () {} // handle display 
        

    function createRadar(sheets, tabletop)  // uses Tabletop module
        var columnNames = tabletop.sheets(sheetName).column_names; // column Names = data form
        var all = tabletop.sheets(sheetName).all();

- see all */models/* to understand models of quadrants, rings, ect ... that are used to fetch data and plot the radars
    - quandrants refers to category
    - rings refers to maturity states
- look at */graphing/radar.js* for radar plotting

**Tips and Tricks** :
- At the end of a *.js file, specify *module.exports = whatever;* in ordel to webpack to identify dependences and modules. The function called must be coherent wth the name after module.exports
    - For example in factory.js, the export should be *module.exports = GoogleInput;* when calling GoogleInput in site.js
    - For example in factory.js, the export should be *module.exports = TrelloInput;* when calling TrelloInput in site.js
}

## What was added
In order to be able to change the data source 


**1. Creating radar from data in the code**
- Added function createRadarFromData() {} in */util/factory.js* / const GoogleSheet 
- You can see there the needed data format


    var all = [ { name: "Charlie", ring: "adopt", quadrant: "Unicorn", isNew: "TRUE", description: "yolo" }, 
        { name: "Chaaaa", ring: "adopt", quadrant: "Unicorn2", isNew: "TRUE", description: "yolo2" }, 
        { name: "The non beliver", ring: "ringolo", quadrant: "Unicorn3", isNew: "TRUE", description: "yolo3" }, 
        { name: "The Unicorn", ring: "ringTest", quadrant: "Magic Trees", isNew: "FALSE", description: "Adequate" }
    ];

**2. Creating radar from private trello board**
- **Added ref for Trello clientjs** in */src/index.html*


    /!\ to use, you must replace your developper key. Also asking for a token, the user that log in the trello board url (written in code) must be user in this specific board to allow access
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://api.trello.com/1/client.js?key=[yourKey]"></script>


- **Added file trelloHelper.js** in  */util/* to deal with Trello input // using [Client.js](https://developers.trello.com/clientjs) from Trello
    - /!\ the trello URL is written in the code
    - /!\ to match the requirement of 4 quadrants and 4 rings, Trello lists of states (Mainstream ...) and Trello labels of category (Cloud, Data ...) are cut to have only 4 elements so when dealing with what to do next to plot more category, this code must be reviewed
- **Created const TrelloInput and TrelloBoard** in  */util/factory.js*, copiying on GoogleSheetInput and GoogleSheet
- in TrelloBoard, **copied and adapted createRadar function to have createRadarFromTrello**


## What to do next
- Maybe refactor code do deal properly with functional programming 
- Work on */graphing/radar.js* to disable the basic plot of 4 radars and have only a list of category to choose
